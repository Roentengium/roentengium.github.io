    <h1>Rating</h1>
    <h2>7/10</h2>
    <p>"All American Boys" is a great book which touches on controversial topics such as police brutality and racism. The book does a great job at highlighting and emulating some of the racial biases
    and inaction that comes along with many similar real world cases. The book allows you to take a more personal angle with a case of profiling and police brutality. Many times in real life we see 
    cases like this on a TV screen which adds a certain level of detachment, with "All American Boys" you get the perspective of the family, friends, and victim that adds a significant more amount
    of humanity which is very thought provoking. This book absolutey deserves the 7/10 ive given it.</p>
